The Bridging Racial Violence project aims to create a machine learning classifier that can idenfity whether a newspaper article contains an instance of racial violence. The time period of focus is the post-reconstruction United States, with particular emphasis on Black-owned publications such as The Atlanta Daily World, Pittsburgh Courier, Los Angeles Sentinel and New York Amsterdam. The notebooks in this repository cover web scraping articles from the New York Times as well as various natural language processing analyses performed on the coded articles to highlight differences in coverage and analyze the actors involved in instances of racial violence.
